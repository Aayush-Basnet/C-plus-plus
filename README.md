### Bi-Implication 
Bi-Implication: 
The bi-implication of p and q, denoted in mathematics by p⟺q, is short hand for the statement "p if and only if q". As such, bi-implication requires q to be True only when p is True. In other words, bi-implication fails (is False) when p is True and q is False or when p is False and q is True.

### Conjunction 
Conjunction:
A conjunction is a statement formed by adding two statements with the connector AND. The symbol for conjunction is '∧' which can be read as 'and'. When two statements p and q are joined in a statement, the conjunction will be expressed symbolically as p ∧ q. Conjunction is true when both statements are true, otherwise false.

### Floor and celing function
Floor function
In mathematics and computer science, the floor function is the function that takes as
input a real number x, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to x,
denoted ⌊x⌋ or floor(x).
For example, ⌊3.4⌋ = 3, ⌊−3.4⌋ = −4.
Ceiling function
Similarly, the ceiling function maps x to the least integer greater than or equal to x,
denoted ⌈x⌉ or ceil(x).
For example, ⌈2.4⌉ = 3, and ⌈−2.4⌉ = −2.
